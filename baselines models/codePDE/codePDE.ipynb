      "### 1. Implementation Plan\n",
      "\n",
      "My approach to implementing the PDE solver is based on the **Method of Lines**, using a simple and robust numerical scheme suitable for GPU acceleration with PyTorch.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Framework Selection:** I will use **PyTorch** for this task. Its tensor computation capabilities are ideal for handling the batch processing requirement, and its convolution functions provide a highly efficient way to compute the spatial derivatives on a GPU.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Numerical Scheme:**\n",
      "    *   **Time Integration:** I will use the **Forward Euler method**. This is an explicit, first-order method that is straightforward to implement. To ensure numerical stability, a small internal time step `dt` will be chosen, likely constrained more by the fast reaction dynamics than the diffusion term.\n",
      "    *   **Spatial Discretization:** The Laplacian operator ($\\nabla^2 u$) will be discretized using a **second-order 5-point finite difference stencil**. This operation can be efficiently implemented as a 2D convolution over the spatial grid, which is a significant performance advantage on GPUs.\n",
      "    *   **Boundary Conditions:** The No-Flux (Neumann) boundary conditions will be handled by padding the spatial grid before the convolution. PyTorch's `replicate` padding mode is a perfect and efficient way to implement this, as it effectively sets the normal derivative to zero at the boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Code Structure:** The code will be modularized for clarity and reusability:\n",
      "    *   An auxiliary function, `_compute_laplacian_2d`, will be created to handle the diffusion term calculation, including padding and convolution.\n",
      "    *   Another auxiliary function, `_compute_reactions`, will calculate the non-spatial reaction terms for all three state variables ($u, v, w$). This function will encapsulate all the complex ionic current logic.\n",
      "    *   The main `solver` function will orchestrate the simulation. It will handle initialization, manage the time-stepping loop, call the helper functions, and format the output.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Execution Flow:**\n",
      "    *   The solver will first initialize the device (preferring CUDA if available), model parameters, and discretization constants (`dx`, `dt`).\n",
      "    *   Input NumPy arrays will be converted to PyTorch tensors and moved to the selected device.\n",
      "    *   The main loop will iterate through the user-provided evaluation times (`t_eval`). For each target time, it will perform multiple smaller time steps using the Forward Euler method until the target time is reached.\n",
      "    *   At each `t_eval` point, the current state of the system will be saved.\n",
      "    *   Finally, the collected states (including the initial state) will be stacked into tensors of shape `[batch_size, len(t_eval) + 1, N, N]` and returned.\n",
      "    *   Informative print statements will track the solver's progress.\n",
